OS-Level Virtualization
Docker leverages Linux kernel features such as namespaces and cgroups to provide process isolation without full virtual machines.

Image Layering Model
Docker images consist of immutable layers stacked atop each other. Each Dockerfile instruction generates a new layer.

Copy-on-Write Filesystems
Containers use copy-on-write filesystems, enabling efficient storage and fast startup by sharing image layers across containers.

Container Lifecycle
Containers transition through created, running, stopped, and removed states. Runtime behavior is governed by the container runtime.

Build Cache Optimization
Layer caching accelerates builds. Ordering Dockerfile instructions from least to most frequently changing improves cache efficiency.

Multi-Stage Builds
Multi-stage builds separate build-time and runtime dependencies, producing smaller and more secure images.

Docker Networking
Containers communicate via virtual networks. DNS-based service discovery enables inter-container communication using service names.

Persistent Storage
Volumes decouple data from container lifecycles, ensuring persistence across restarts and deployments.

Environment Configuration
Configuration is externalized via environment variables, enabling the same image to run across environments.

Production Considerations
Resource limits, health checks, logging, and monitoring are essential for stable containerized systems.
